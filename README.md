# EMG-Feature Extraction
This project aims to develop a digital signal processing system using Electromyography (EMG) signals to extract features that can be utilized in machine learning applications. EMG signals are electrical signals generated by muscle activity, which can be measured using electrodes placed on the skin's surface. These signals are commonly used in various applications such as prosthetics, motion analysis, and human-computer interaction.
